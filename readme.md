   - Built main content area with proper spacing

2. **Data Visualization**
   - Initially implemented with Recharts
   - Later migrated to Chart.js for better performance and smaller bundle size
   - Created 10+ different chart types (Line, Bar, Doughnut, Scatter)

### Phase 3: Performance Optimization
1. **React Optimizations**
   - Implemented lazy loading for all chart components
   - Added memoization for expensive calculations
   - Used Suspense boundaries for better loading states

2. **Bundle Optimization**
   - Removed react-is dependency by switching from Recharts to Chart.js
   - Implemented tree-shaking for Chart.js components
   - Optimized image loading and asset management

### Phase 4: Loading States & UX
1. **Skeleton Loading**
   - Created comprehensive skeleton components
   - Implemented staggered loading animations
   - Added shimmer effects for better perceived performance

2. **Interactive Elements**
   - Real-time data updates for visitor metrics
   - Hover states and smooth transitions
   - Responsive chart interactions

### Phase 5: Mobile Responsiveness
1. **Mobile-First Approach**
   - Implemented mobile sidebar toggle
   - Optimized touch targets and interactions
   - Created responsive grid layouts

2. **Cross-Device Testing**
   - Ensured consistent experience across devices
   - Optimized chart rendering for mobile screens
   - Implemented proper accessibility features

## üîß Assumptions Made

### Data & API
- **Mock Data**: Used realistic sample data for all charts and metrics
- **Static Implementation**: No backend integration assumed for this demo
- **Data Structure**: Assumed standard marketing analytics data formats
- **Update Frequency**: Real-time chart updates every 3 seconds for demo purposes

### User Experience
- **Target Audience**: D2C marketers and analytics professionals
- **Device Usage**: Primary desktop usage with mobile support
- **Browser Support**: Modern browsers with ES6+ support
- **Internet Connection**: Stable connection for real-time features

### Business Logic
- **Metrics Calculation**: Standard marketing formulas (ROAS, conversion rates)
- **Time Zones**: UTC assumed for all time-based data
- **Currency**: USD assumed for all financial metrics
- **Attribution Models**: Standard digital marketing attribution methods

### Technical Constraints
- **Performance Budget**: Target < 3s initial load time
- **Bundle Size**: Optimized for < 1MB initial JavaScript bundle
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance target
- **Browser Compatibility**: Modern browsers (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+)
